Programming for Big Data Analysis Project on Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market

Project Description

In this project we will use text analysis methods to extract the data from Twitter using tweetpy package on R. We are factoring the word “bitcoin”

Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

We will follow the data analysis lifecycle to prepare the data, perform exploratory analysis and modeling, validate the data and visualize and present the findings.
Using the Twitter Developer API we collected tweet data on the topic chosen by the group over a period of time and store it in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). We performed Text Analysis with the tweets.
Created classification models using all models covered in this class (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes). We Also used Clustering and Non-Linear Regression.
For the Findings, we have attached a PowerPoint presentation.
