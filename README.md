Programming for Big Data Analysis Project on Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market

Project Description

In this project we extracted the data from Twitter using tweetpy package on R. We are factoring the word “bitcoin” 

Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

We followed data analysis lifecycle to prepare the data, performed exploratory analysis and modeling, validate the data and visualized and present the findings.
Using the Twitter Developer API we collected tweet data on Bitcoin and stored it in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). We performed Text Analysis with the tweets, classification models using all models covered in class (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes). We Also used Clustering and Non-Linear Regression.
For our results and conclusions we created a Powerpoint presentation. See attached files.
